## Summary

Intention of the application is to search through current laws and regulations. While also notifying users to new bills from local up to federal.
## Intended users

For individuals who intend on learning about government laws and see what local bills and the contents of those bills are.

> Citizens should have much easier access to laws and be notified of new bills that might effect them

Laws should be mainstream knowledge not hidden and more exposure is a good way to change political climate and ensure real change

>  As a citizen I am tired of not knowing what is going on in the country and I would benefit in knowing more about the country I live in. Having knowledge is the most powerful thing to happen.
